### Code Standards and Formatting
Follow all standards and norms specific to the language of the file you are modifying. Use double quotes in place of single quotes and provide adequate spacing for readability. Use camelCase for JavaScript identifiers and [kebab-case](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11273282/whats-the-name-for-hyphen-separated-case) for HTML ids and classes and CSS selectors. For anonymous functions, use [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) instead of functions with the `function` statement.
