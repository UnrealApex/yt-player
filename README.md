# From Idea To Reality
The [chromebook](https://www.google.com/chromebook/) is my daily driver. I use it to do schoolwork, I used it for most of my contributions to open source, and I use it for learning. Chromebooks are great, their advantages being affordable for schools and colleges to provide for their students in the masses, simple and easy to use for the average person, and very easy for IT departments to administer. Their biggest strength is also their biggest weakness. Sadly there is nothing in this world that is too good to be true. Its astonishingly cheap price requires laptop manufacterers to make some sacrifices. Those being in their hardware. Chromebooks have low end processors, therefore simple tasks like loading Youtube videos is a challenge that can take several minutes to finish. A Windows or Mac comptuer on the other hand cold load the video in a matter of seconds not taking internet speed into account. In my opinion I think Youtube is very well optimized, but there are several tasks Uoutube performs that are unnessicary for watching a video, and are there simpily for keeping you are their platform longer(recomendations, notifcations, etc ...). The goal of Yt-Player is to reduce the loading time of the videos you want to watch.
