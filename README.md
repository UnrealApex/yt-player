# From Idea To Reality 
The [chromebook](https://www.google.com/chromebook/) is my daily driver. As a student I use it to do schoolwork, I use it for most of my contributions to open source,  and I also use it for learning. Chromebooks are for the most part are great. Their advantages being affordability, simplicity, and, being very easy for IT departments to administer. Their biggest strength is unfortunately also their biggest weakness.Their astonishingly cheap price require laptop manufacterers to make some sacrifices. Those being in their hardware. Chromebooks have low end processors, therefore tasks like loading Youtube videos are a challenge that can take several minutes to finish. A Windows or Mac computer on the other hand could load the video in a matter of seconds not taking internet speed into account. In some cases you won't have time to wait for a page to fully load or an advertisement to play. In my opinion I think Youtube is very well optimized,but there are several tasks Youtube performs that are unnecessary for loading a video and are present to keep you on the platform longer(recomendations,notifcations,etc...). The goal of YT-Player is to reduce the loading time of the videos you enjoy the you want. So you can view the content you want quicker and without the need to watch ads
